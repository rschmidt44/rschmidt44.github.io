The Williams College Course Catalog is an example of a good design.  It offers the user the ability to seamlessly navigate between subject, when courses are offered, and the specifics/requirements of every course. 



## The Steps Involved

***1. The Starting Point***
Here we are able to choose from each class selection.  Each subject is highlighted in light blue to indicate our ability to click.  Subcategories are listed below their respective headers in smaller font.  Clickable links also turn black when the mouse is placed over them, signifying the ability of the user to click through, as is the case on many other websites and computer programs.

***2. Select a Time of the Year***
Now that the user has selected the subject, they get to decide exactly which classes they want to look at, whether it be all of them or classes broken down by type or difficulty.

***3. Select Your Class***
This portion allows users to select specific course offerings, based on title, time, professor, and enrollment capacity.  Clickable links allow the user to investigate each course offering.  Students typically use this section to prepare for an upcoming semester or last minute to adjust class schedules.  The ability to narrow in by subject, timeframe or difficulty, and finally by specific class gives students the ability to explore a multitude of options, or reach specific options quickly.
