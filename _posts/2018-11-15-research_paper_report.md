Paper: [Developing a Context-aware Electronic Tourist Guide: Some Issues and Experiences](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=332047) 

The GUIDE system described and studied in this paper aims to give people a multi-option navigation system around a city.  Its main offers are to act as “an intelligent tour guide” or “richly featured guidebook”.  More generally, it aimed to gives users autonomy in their exploration of a city, giving them versatility in how to navigate the city and how much they wanted to interact with the technology itself.  The authors tested the system using both an expert walkthrough to evaluate system usability.  The findings included normalizing the button layout to match other browsers and adjusting projected tour times based on human walking rates.  It was then put through user tests.  A small proportion of users believed that “less is more” when it comes to the system’s functionality.  Subjects overwhelmingly enjoyed using the navigation system to explore the city and trusted the information presented to them.   However, some users found the functionality a little overwhelming and so the authors hypothesize it may be useful to allow the users to choose the degree of functionality.  In navigation, with varying age groups and comfort levels with technology, allowing the user to decide on their level of participation with the product seems to be an effective way to mitigate the isolation felt by some users.

I think this paper does a good job of supporting the general trends and optionality we have implemented in our design.  I do, however, wish we had integrated some varying levels of functionality in our design, so as to provide the user with different levels of engagement.  I believe our design is accessible by every user, but may not completely satisfy someone with intense interest.  With this in mind, I believe our design very effectively encapsulates the “less is more” principal. There are not layers on layers of information in our design, as there were with GUIDE, and so the user is not easily lost or fearing that they’ve missed information or functionality.  Overall, we have followed the road set by the GUIDE system and incorporated some of the adjustments that the authors suggest would be an improvement.
