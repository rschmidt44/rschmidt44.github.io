**The Mission Showers**

The mission showers present an example of bad design.  At first glance they seem intutive, you turn the handle to hot or cold.  This allows water to flow from the bottom faucet, but what about when you want to take a shower?  This becomes harder.  There is a nob, that upon inspection seems to be able to pushed, pulled, or twisted.  To make matters worse, it is labeled "volume".  This language is not indicative of the common words surrounding shower usage.  It is also unclear whether or not the nob should be used at all to control shower usage, or if so, if it should be used before or after the water is running.  The design of this mechanism is flawed further because it does not take into account the state in which its users will be when they use the shower.  Commonly people take showers either first thing in the morning, when they are groggy, or before bed, when they are tired.  During both times users are not at their sharpest, and so it makes the mechanism ever harder to operate.

The solution to the nob is to run the lower faucet, and then push in the nob to start the shower.
