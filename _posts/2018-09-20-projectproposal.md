**The Problem**

There is a substantial population of people who would qualify as "avid museum goers".  There is also a population of people, including myself, who enjoy museums, but visit them far less frequently and are less well versed in their structures, viewing etiquette, and collections.  Those falling into the less than avid museum goer category may find it tricky to navigate what can be a maze of art as well as find exhibits and pieces they enjoy viewing and learning about.  Specifically in WCMA, the upper level can trap a visitor in a specific section if you’re not careful.  With all the corners and small pockets, it is easy to miss pieces that may have been interesting to you.  The museum would also be unable to tell if certain sections were getting considerably less traffic than others.

After observing WCMA guests during class, it became clear that people do a lot of wandering and they take breaks.  When people found a piece they were interested in, they stopped, viewed, and read the description.  During breaks, visitors chose the larger comfy sofas that were located between exhibits (with no art to in view) over some of the more rigid benches within the exhibits.  Below are some examples of the different areas people may spend some their time at the museum.

The problem for the visitor is that the majority of their time may be spent grazing the art spread across the exhibit or not looking at art at all (i.e. while resting).  The problem then faced by the museum is to engage the visitor at all stages of their visit, maximize their viewing, route them purposefully, and most importantly track and analyze those patterns. 

**What does the problem look like?**

Anyone visiting a museum for the first time knows that navigating it can quickly turn into a nightmare, and a paper map really doesn’t really cut it.  There’s a chance you miss a piece you would have really enjoyed or you don’t know where to look to find it in the first place.  In WCMA, the walls change colors as you move from room to room, and the themes/exhibit changes as well.  This is helpful to navigate, but not in navigating to a piece of art that specifically interests you.  

So, how do you customize someone’s journey, or simply view an exhibit the way the curator intended? Giving someone the means to guide him or herself, developing a path based on where you’ve been in the museum adds quality to the experience.  Then being able to see how each visitor interacted with the space gives the museum instantaneous feedback: path taken, time at each piece, and time spent out of the exhibit.  As was reiterated to us by WCMA staff, being able to track data points for each piece is very important, so it seems logical that the duration something was viewed, the order it was viewed, and its position in the exhibit as a whole would lend itself towards enhancing both the exhibit and viewer experience.
