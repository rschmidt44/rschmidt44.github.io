**The Problem**

There is a substantial population of people who would qualify as "avid museum goers".  There is also a population of people, including myself, who enjoy museums, but visit them far less frequently and are less well versed in their structures, viewing etiquette, and collections.  Those falling into the less than avid museum goer category may find it tricky to navigate what can be a maze of a building as well as find exhibits and pieces they enjoying viewing and learning about.  After observing WCMA guests during class, it became clear that people do a lot of wandering and they take breaks.  When people found a piece they were interested in, they stopped, viewed, and read the description.  During breaks, visitors chose the larger comfy sofas that were located between exhibits (with no art to in view) over some of the more rigid benches within the exhibits.  

The problem for the visitor is that the majority of their time may be spent grazing the art or not looking at art at all.  The complimentary problem faced by the museum is to engage the visitor at all stages of their visit, maximize their viewing, route them inconspicuously, and most importantly track and analyze those patterns.
