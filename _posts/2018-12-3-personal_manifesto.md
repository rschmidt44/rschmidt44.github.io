The design process is one in which we strive to combine the wishes of many into something that works well.  In essence you must bridge the gap between, “Good design is when I like it. –Everybody,” and, “[Design] is not just what it looks like and feels like.  Design is how it works. –Steve Jobs” ([Learning to See](https://ia.net/topics/learning-to-see)).

We end up with something like this, where ideally you get a product that is pretty and works, but at the very least just works.  Ideas that lie in the very top right hand portion of this graph are hard to come by, so how do we get there?  Very rarely will a product be an exact match to every user’s needs.  It’s my job to plan in such a way that my design takes into account as many user characteristics as possible, without throwing other users to the side.  It becomes hard to do that when the way you see a product is not the way your user sees it.  The trouble with being a designer is that “…once we have learned to see design, both good and bad, we cannot un-see it.  The downside is that the more you learn to see, the more you lose your “common” eye, the eye you design for” ([Learning to See](https://ia.net/topics/learning-to-see)).  I do not claim to have developed this “sight” and I still very much look at things with a “common” eye, but the sentiment remains true, even for as an amateur designer, that I inherently lose my ability to objectively judge or understand a product once I’m involved in its design.  Similarly, the issue of designing for what someone says they want, versus what they actually need becomes even more convoluted and at times needs to be addressed directly.  This manifesto will serve to break down the biggest obstacles and crucial factors in approaching design that I have found through self-reflection on my own design process.


### Less is More
In my own design process, I found that good ideas don’t just appear out of thin air.  They start from many small ideas, building steam, swapping pieces, and starting over until you get it right.  This brings us to something I learned very quickly in the design process: less is more.  You might think I’m talking about an end product, where a sleeker design is in fact more desirable, but what I’m referring to is that less starts with more, and the starting point is key.  Brainstorming ideas, planning next steps, and synthesizing feedback are all processes that act as funnels.  They can start with exorbitant amounts of information, especially if your project is large in scale.  The process of building these ideas up and then whittling them down is vital, although it may seem daunting.  I’ve come to adopt the idea of “quality through quantity”.  As Nobel Prize winning chemist Linus Pauling said, “The best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas” ([How to be Creative]( http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/how-to-be-creative.html)).  Your best idea may not be your first idea, it sure wasn’t mine, but it will come if you give it time.  

In theory, coming up with a lot of ideas sounds well and good, but in most cases members of teams may not agree on tactics, strategy, and execution.  I found that setting ground rules and a general framework for the working style of the group is a good place to start.  In my own group, I found that shared leadership roles, individual and mutual accountability, and discussing, deciding, and doing real work together created a strong environment for success (The Discipline of Teams – NEED TO CITE MANUALLY).  By sharing leadership roles, I avoided stringent power dynamics and flatten any hierarchal structures that form.  I also found that being “in charge” of various tasks brings out beneficial qualities in team members that otherwise would not have been unearthed.  Through sharing leadership roles and evenly distributing tasks to people you’re also able to have natural checks and balances within the team.  By seeing my teammates do a good job, I was motivated to do a good job, keeping people accountable to themselves and others.  Finally, doing work together may have been the single most effective way to produce a good outcome.  It’s easy to meet, split tasks, and then put the pieces together remotely for submission.  By doing at least part of this process as a group, physically in the same place, I found that some of our best ideas or adjustments came to fruition.  It not that these ideas are impossible to find individually, but by having my teammates as instant resources for short conversations, I got more developed and unified ideas quicker.  It saves time and streamlines the process.  As I found all along, doing a little more at the beginning led to a stronger, simpler, and more cohesive process, and therefore product in the end.  


### I am Not the User

I believe one of the cardinal rules of design was to remember that I am not the user.  In the context of museum technology, I found myself constantly thinking, “I go to museums, and so I’m a user.”  This is dangerous because it puts the power entirely in my hands, and I’m not a representative sample.  Even if I do go to museums, so do one thousand other people who have experiences that are nothing like mine, and therefore a design that serves just me misses the mark on serving them as well.  That’s why it’s imperative to remember that a design is best suited to serve the user, not yourself.  One of the big questions I found myself returning to was, “How do I get in the mind of the user?” and, “How do I stay there?”  Through the fly on the wall observations, contextual inquiries, and talking through our ideas with other groups I formed a basic understanding of the users my product was for and then derived tasks to embody those users desires.  This understanding was solidified through the use of storyboards to bring the tasks to life.  Backed by the collected data, the picture unfolded of what the user wanted through what they liked/disliked, what was missing, and what could have been better.  Below is an example of a storyboard that encapsulates a user’s use of the product from start to finish.

After being able to separate my own wants or needs from that of the users, the next biggest challenge was distinguishing what I thought a user wanted from what the user actually needed.


### Research !=(always) Design—It’s Ok to Correct

One of the trickiest parts of the design process ended up being translating my research into a design.  What made it so tricky is that I, and my group, identified the flaw once we were already pretty far into the design process.  We had chosen a technological medium, made a paper prototype, and had begun user testing.  Below is a picture of our first paper prototype, which included both a kiosk and phone app.

What we found through user testing was that the data we had collected and the tasks we believed users wanted to complete were mostly accurate, but the way in which we designed our product to address the tasks was confusing for users.  What people told us they wanted was not necessarily what they ended up needing.  At first it seemed like our entire process had failed, but by taking a few steps back the group was able to pinpoint the where the design went awry.  I learned that adjusting and testing multiple iterations of a product was not only a good idea, but also gave me confidence in the final product.  I also began to understand that it’s ok to correct, and that I wasn’t expected to get it right on the first try.  After scrapping the kiosks and switching out one of the tasks, our design morphed into this:

… a much cleaner and simpler to use product that fit the research and was rated highly with users.  


### Accesibility: Thinking about the user

As I’ve touched on in multiple places, the user is paramount in the design process.  That means that as a designer I have a responsibility to make my product as accessible to each user as possible.  Phrased in a different way, designs should be inclusive.  Designs can address this in multiple ways.  I believe one of the most effective methods is to “Think POUR”.  This framework comes from Andrew Smyk in his Adobe Blog post([Design With Accessibility in Mind]( https://theblog.adobe.com/design-with-accessibility-in-mind-the-pour-methodology/)).  POUR stands for perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.  For something to be perceivable, it means that it should embody a structure, such that no matter how the information is presented, the organization remains comprehendible.  Operable refers to the affordances given to the user in order for them to be able to navigate appropriately.  A design is understandable if the perceivable content has meaning and makes sense.  Finally, a design is robust if it is compatible and up to date with standards and/or other technologies.  Encompassed in POUR is an inclusion how-to for designers.  In my own design, we used simple, uncluttered screens to make it perceivable, back and home buttons to make it operable, and clearly defined button/task names as well as contrasted simple color schemes to make it understandable.  The robust stage is mostly left out since our designs are not being developed into apps.  Below are a few examples of our digital mock-ups that illustrate these principles.

Had my design been developed into an app, it would have been important to consider screen-readers, information for people with physical or motor disabilities, and incorporating potential keyboard or voice-command use.  


### Personal Code of Ethics

My design process has traversed thinking about museums and their stakeholders, I’ve crossed paths with many people through contextual inquiries and user tests, I’ve thought about various technologies and their interplays with both humans and other types of technology, and I’ve worked closely with my design team, all in service of a single end product.  All of these different interactions and communications make up a web of social relationships that my design touch and further interact with.  Therefore, it is necessary to think about the implications for all parties involved.  At the heart of it, all these interactions stem from the creation of my design, and so my design is at fault if any wrongdoing occurs.  Since a design can be boiled down to the sum of its design team, I am responsible for those wrongdoings.  Designs themselves can seem harmless and features can be added for their upside without any concern for their downside.  For example, SWCMA includes a tracking operation so that users can see their own and the paths of others through the museum.  Tracking may seem harmless, but as we’ve seen with Strava’s heat map, simple tracking of users locations turned into a nightmare for the military and intelligence communities ([The Strava Heatmap and the End of Secrets]( https://www.wired.com/story/strava-heat-map-military-bases-fitness-trackers-privacy/)).  That function probably seemed genius when it was drawn up on a whiteboard, but its real world implications could lead to serious danger for those affected.  Although it may seem extreme to scale someone’s path during a museum visit up from trivial to a national security threat, the truth is that nobody noticed Strava’s error until it was too late.  In SCMA’s design the tracking is turned on and off by the user on the home screen.  This example and others like it have motivated me to think about how each decision must be accounted for under unwavering guidelines.  I’ve outlined some that I find essential below.

#### Do No Harm
Any design that prioritizes its own functioning over someone’s safety is, in my opinion, a bad design.  This extends beyond physical harm into emotional, social, and financial harm as well.  I will hold myself to the standard to not design products that can injure, discriminate, emotionally scar, target, or personally identify specific users.   This includes both explicit (malicious) and accidental (unknown) features.

#### Admit Shortcomings Honestly and Swiftly
The reality of any product is that despite best efforts, not all bad outcomes can be predicted.  The important step is to admit and fix mistakes honestly and quickly.  This means taking extreme steps to protect users, including recalling the product or discontinuing it if necessary.

#### Take Responsibility 
I believe it is important to take ownership of a design.  Despite regulatory, or lack thereof, loopholes and the potential to thwart blame, I will always hold myself as a responsible party in any failure or flaw of a product I design.



Designs are built, at their most basic level, to make something we do as people easier or to allow us to do something we otherwise wouldn’t have been able to do.  Everything artificial in the world has been designed to be the way it is (The psychopathology of everyday things).  I’ve learned that the process one takes in design doesn’t have to be extravagant or overly complex.  In fact, there is irony in an overly complex design process yielding a simple design.  Personally, I like to put the burden on my back.  I’m responsible for the premise of my design, addressing the audience of my design, the changes in my design, the implications of my design, and the inclusiveness of my design.  It’s not a seamless process, but it’s a start and one I’ll continue to develop on every design journey I take.
